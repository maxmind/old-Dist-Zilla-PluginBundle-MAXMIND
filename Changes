0.12     2015-11-04

- Added the Dist::Zilla::Role::PluginBundle::Config::Slicer role to the bundle
  to faciliate config tweaks in dist.ini files.


0.11     2015-05-14

- Always set xt_mode to true for Test::Compile


0.10     2015-05-12

- Disabled the Subroutines::ProhibitExplicitReturnUndef perlcritic rule in the
  generated perlcriticrc file.


0.09     2015-04-01

- Make sure that the generated .mailmap file is sorted so we don't re-order it
  every time we regenerate it.


0.08     2015-03-09

- Replaced PkgVersion with BumpVersionAfterRelease and added
  CheckVersionIncrement and Test::Version for good measure.

- Added Test::TidyAll and a plugin to generate default tidyall.ini,
  perltidyrc, and perlcriticrc files for our distros.


0.07     2015-01-26

- Respect the license set in the dist.ini. Previously this would be ignored
  and the default "perl5" license would be used.


0.06     2015-01-06

- Fix copyright holder for this distro. My own dzil global config messed up
  the last release.


0.05     2015-01-06

- Respect the copyright_holder set in the dist.ini if one exists.


0.04     2014-11-12

- Don't delete the .mailmap file after writing to it, and don't overwrite any
  existing entries.


0.03     2014-11-02

- Exclude plugins shipped with this bundle when checking for stale modules.


0.02     2014-10-23

- Require the latest Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::EOL (0.14) and switch from
  EOLTests to Test::EOL.


0.01     2014-10-22

- First release upon an unsuspecting world.
